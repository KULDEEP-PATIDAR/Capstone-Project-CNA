Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Spaces 
This project simulates a real-time dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces using historical and streaming data.
Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
> Price increases linearly with occupancy:


- Base Price: `$10`
- Alpha: `2`

Dataset
- 73 days of data
- 18 time steps per day (30-min intervals)
- Features: Lot ID, Occupancy, Capacity, Timestamp

Features
- Real-time price calculation
- Interactive visualizations using Bokeh
- Tabbed UI for all 14 parking lots

Files
- `capstone-project.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with full implementation

- Built With

- Python, Pandas, Bokeh
- Google Colab (hosted runtime)
